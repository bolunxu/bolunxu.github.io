I am an Assistant Professor in Columbia University [Earth and Environmental Engineering](https://eee.columbia.edu/), with affiliation in [Electrical Engineering](https://ee.columbia.edu/).
I am a core faculty at [Columbia Electrochemical Energy Center](https://ceec.engineering.columbia.edu/) and [Lenfest Center for Sustainable Energy](http://energy.columbia.edu/). My research interests include design and optimization of sustainable energy and power systems, integration of energy storage and other emerging decarbonization technologies, and modeling the impact of climate change in energy systems.

I obtained my PhD in Electrical Engineering from University of Washington, Seattle, advised by
[Daniel Kirschen](http://labs.ece.uw.edu/real/real_pe.html) and
[Baosen Zhang](https://zhangbaosen.github.io/). I did my Postdoc in MIT, hosted by [Audun Botterud](http://botterud.mit.edu/).
My CV is [here](assets/files/Xu_CV.pdf).
